# WebScrapping-with-Python
This code scrapes a website for book information and stores it in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. It uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to retrieve and parse HTML content, and extracts book titles, prices, and availabilities from the webpage using BeautifulSoup. The resulting DataFrame contains information about all of the books on the webpage.
